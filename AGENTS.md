# Semver Analyzer — Agent Guide

## Project Overview

A multi-language semver analysis tool built in Rust. Compares two versions of a
library (via git refs), detects breaking changes, and generates Konveyor
migration rules with fix strategies.

### Architecture

- `crates/core/` — Language-agnostic diff engine, types, traits
- `crates/ts/` — TypeScript/React-specific: source profiles, JSX analysis, CSS
  profiles, konveyor rule generation
- `crates/konveyor-core/` — Konveyor rule types and fix strategy framework
- `crates/llm/` — LLM integration for behavioral analysis
- `src/orchestrator.rs` — Pipeline orchestrator (TD+BU or TD+SD)
- `src/main.rs` — CLI entry point

### Three Pipelines

The analyzer has three pipelines. The `--pipeline-v2` flag controls which
combination runs.

#### TD (Top-Down) — Structural API Diff

**Always runs.** Extracts `.d.ts` API surfaces at both git refs, then diffs
them to detect:

- Renamed, removed, added symbols (constants, interfaces, type-aliases)
- Type changes on properties
- Signature changes (base class, return type)
- Relocations (moved to deprecated/, next/ promoted)
- Member-level renames within interfaces

Key files: `crates/core/src/diff/` (mod.rs, rename.rs, compare.rs, relocate.rs,
migration.rs)

#### BU (Bottom-Up) — Behavioral Analysis (v1 only)

**Runs when `--pipeline-v2` is NOT set.** Walks the git diff bottom-up:

1. Parse changed functions from git diff
2. For each changed function, find associated test files
3. Check test assertion changes → behavioral break
4. If private function has behavioral break → walk UP call graph to public API
5. Optionally runs LLM analysis on changed files for deeper behavioral insights

Key files: `src/orchestrator.rs` (run() method, lines 56–305)

#### SD (Source-Level Diff) — Deterministic Source Analysis (v2 only)

**Runs when `--pipeline-v2` IS set.** Replaces BU with deterministic AST-based
analysis:

1. Extract `ComponentSourceProfile` for each component at both refs
2. Diff profiles to produce `SourceLevelChange` entries:
   - DOM structure, ARIA, role, data attribute changes
   - CSS token usage, prop-style bindings
   - Portal usage, context dependencies
   - Forward ref, memo, composition
   - Prop defaults, children slot path
   - Managed attribute overrides (prop-overrides-attribute)
3. Build composition trees and conformance checks
4. Extract CSS profiles for class/variable removal detection

Key files: `crates/ts/src/source_profile/`, `crates/ts/src/sd_pipeline.rs`,
`crates/ts/src/composition/`

### Pipeline Selection

```sh
# v1: TD + BU (structural + behavioral)
semver-analyzer analyze typescript --repo ... --from v5 --to v6

# v2: TD + SD (structural + source-level) — default for pipeline runs
semver-analyzer analyze typescript --repo ... --from v5 --to v6 --pipeline-v2
```

Both produce an `AnalysisReport` with the same top-level structure. v1 populates
`breaking_behavioral_changes`, v2 populates `sd_result` (source_level_changes,
composition_trees, conformance_checks, etc.).

Rule generation (`konveyor` subcommand) also accepts `--pipeline-v2` to enable
v2-specific rules (composition, conformance, prop-to-child migration, test
impact, CSS removal, prop-attribute-override).

## Key Rules for Agents

### Rename Detection (CRITICAL)

**Before modifying `crates/core/src/diff/rename.rs`**, read:

- `design/rename-detector-verification.md` — Contains the verification dataset
  (15 known-true renames, 28 known-false renames with similarity scores and root
  causes), the verification procedure, and threshold boundaries.
- Run the verification procedure after any change to confirm no regressions.

#### Generic Type Parameter Normalization

The `normalize_type_structure()` function strips generic type parameters from
normalized `_T_` placeholders. This ensures that types like `ReactElement` and
`ReactElement<any>` produce identical normalized fingerprints (`_T_`), enabling
rename detection when the only type difference is a default generic parameter.

Without this, renamed props with trivially-different generic parameters (e.g.,
`labelIcon: ReactElement` → `labelHelp: ReactElement<any>`) fail all four
rename passes and are emitted as separate Removed + Added entries instead of
a single Renamed.

### Source Profile Extraction

Source profiles are extracted in `crates/ts/src/source_profile/`. Submodules:

- `mod.rs` — Main extraction, JSX walking (also detects cloneElement inline)
- `prop_defaults.rs` — Default value extraction from destructuring
- `prop_style.rs` — Prop-to-CSS-class binding detection
- `managed_attrs.rs` — Prop-overrides-attribute dataflow tracing
- `diff.rs` — Profile diffing to produce SourceLevelChange entries
- `bem.rs` — BEM CSS structure parsing
- `children_slot.rs` — Children wrapper path tracing + CSS token detail
- `clone_element.rs` — cloneElement prop injection detection
- `react_api.rs` — React API usage detection (portal, memo, forwardRef)

### Composition Tree V2 Architecture (CRITICAL)

The v2 composition tree builder (`build_composition_tree_v2` in
`composition/mod.rs`) replaces BEM-based edge creation with evidence-based
signals. **BEM determines family membership only. All parent-child edges come
from structural evidence.**

#### Signal Steps (in order)

| Step | Signal | Strength | Rationale |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Internal rendering | Required | Component literally renders the child |
| 2 | CSS direct-child `>` | Required | Styles require exact parent-child DOM |
| 3 | CSS grid parent-child | Required | Layout breaks without grid container |
| 3b | CSS implicit grid child | Required | Same — grid layout dependency |
| 4 | CSS flex context | Allowed | Layout preference, not strict |
| 5 | CSS descendant ` ` | Allowed | Works at any depth |
| 6 | React context | Required | Null context = crash/broken behavior |
| 7 | DOM nesting | Required | Invalid HTML without correct parent |
| 8 | cloneElement | Required | Missing injected props breaks functionality |

After all steps, members with zero incoming edges are dropped from the tree
(no "default to root" guessing).

#### EdgeStrength: Required vs Allowed

Every edge has a `strength: EdgeStrength` field:

- **Required** — Rendering breaks without this nesting. Generates conformance
  rules (`notParent` checks in the scanner).
- **Allowed** — Valid placement documented in CSS but not the only option. Stays
  in the tree for migration guidance but produces zero conformance rules.

Conformance rule generation (`konveyor_v2.rs` and `sd_pipeline.rs`) filters
edges by `strength == Required` before generating `notParent` rules.

Collapsed edges (from `collapse_internal_nodes`) inherit the **stronger** of
the two edges in the chain.

#### CSS Element → Component Mapping (CRITICAL)

`build_css_element_to_component_map` maps CSS BEM element names to React
components via `css_tokens_used`. **Tokens are stored with the `"styles."`
prefix** (e.g., `"styles.drawerBody"`). The mapping function must strip
`"styles."` before matching against the BEM block name. Skip `"styles.modifiers."`
tokens — they don't map to BEM elements.

#### CSS Profile Loading

CSS profiles are loaded from a dependency repo (e.g., `@patternfly/patternfly`).
The orchestrator uses `WorktreeGuard::create_only` for the dep repo (not
`WorktreeGuard::new`, which requires tsconfig.json). The caller-provided build
command (e.g., `yarn install && npx gulp buildPatternfly`) runs directly in
the worktree.

Multiple CSS files per component directory are all read and merged via
`merge_css_profile`. The old `enrich_trees_with_css` function is no longer
called — CSS enrichment is integrated into the v2 builder.

#### children_slot_detail

A parallel field to `children_slot_path` that captures CSS tokens alongside
tag names. Each entry is `(tag_name, Option<css_token>)`. Used by the flex
context step (step 4) to determine what CSS element wraps `{children}`:

```
children_slot_path:   ["div", "div"]
children_slot_detail: [("div", Some("toolbarContent")), ("div", Some("toolbarContentSection"))]
```

Extraction uses a single AST parse via `trace_children_slot_both` (not separate
parses for path and detail).

#### Known Issues

- **Shared CSS token**: Multiple components render the same CSS class (e.g.,
  `DrawerContentBody` and `DrawerPanelBody` both render `__body`). First
  component registered wins in the mapping. Needs multi-component token map
  with parent-context disambiguation.
- **Non-component exports**: Context objects, type exports may appear as family
  members if they have any structural signal. Need filtering.
- **Prop-based composition**: Components passed via props (e.g., `panelContent`
  on DrawerContent) create collapsed edges that look like children composition.
  The TD pipeline handles these separately.

### BEM Block Independence (CRITICAL)

When classifying parent-child relationships via BEM analysis, components with
their own distinct BEM block must be classified as `Independent`, not as
elements of another component's block. There are two code paths that enforce
this:

1. **`classify_bem_relationship()` in `bem.rs`** — Checks `child_block !=
   parent_block` BEFORE token prefix matching. This prevents camelCase naming
   collisions (e.g., `labelGroup` from `label-group` appearing to be element
   `Group` of block `label`).

2. **`infer_ownership_by_name_prefix()` in `composition/mod.rs`** — Uses strict
   block equality (`child_block_lower == root_name_lower`). Only proceeds when
   the child's dominant BEM block is the SAME as the root's name. Rejects all
   cases where they differ, because BEM blocks are stored in camelCase
   (`kebab_to_camel_case` at extraction time), making it impossible to
   distinguish separate blocks from sub-elements by name alone.

**Known collision families** (upstream-verified as independent):
- `label` vs `label-group` (Label / LabelGroup — LabelGroup CONTAINS Labels)
- `alert` vs `alert-group` (Alert / AlertGroup — AlertGroup CONTAINS Alerts)
- `menu` vs `menu-toggle` (Menu / MenuToggle — MenuToggle is a trigger, not a child)
- `form` vs `form-control` (Form / FormControl — separate component)
- `progress` vs `progress-stepper` (Progress / ProgressStepper — unrelated components)

**Never** add a composition edge between components that have different BEM
blocks. If a future PF component genuinely needs cross-block ownership, add
an explicit override rather than weakening the BEM independence checks.

### Composition Rule Generation (CRITICAL)

The rule generator in `konveyor_v2.rs` creates three types of composition rules:

- **`removed-member`** — Fires when a removed component is still used as JSX.
  These are kept and are correct.
- **`requires`** — Removed. Redundant with conformance rules which check the
  same parent-child relationship from the child's perspective (via `notParent`).
  Conformance is more precise because it only fires when the child is misplaced.
- **`new-member`** — Removed. The migration rule (`component-import-deprecated`)
  already lists new child components in its message. New-member rules fired on
  every parent usage regardless of whether the new child was already present.

**Conformance rules are filtered by `EdgeStrength::Required`.** Only edges
where rendering actually breaks (CSS `>` selectors, grid layout, context,
DOM nesting, cloneElement) generate `notParent` conformance rules. Edges from
CSS descendant selectors and flex context (tagged `Allowed`) stay in the tree
for documentation but don't generate scanner rules. This prevents false
positives from CSS descendant selectors that match at any depth.

**Migration rule `when` clauses** (`component-import-deprecated`) use:
- `JSX_PROP` conditions (one per removed prop) for Modified components — only
  fires when a deprecated prop is actually used
- `IMPORT` trigger for fully Removed components — importing a removed component
  is itself the issue
- `child` filter for structural detection — fires when old internal components
  are still used as children

### Type-Incompatible Member Renames (CRITICAL)

When a property is renamed AND its type changes to a structurally different
category (e.g., `splitButtonOptions: SplitButtonOptions` →
`splitButtonItems: ReactNode[]`), the diff engine must emit a **single
`StructuralChangeType::Changed`** entry — NOT separate Removed + Added entries.

- **rename.rs Pass 4** detects these via name similarity (≥0.6 threshold)
- **compare.rs `diff_members()`** separates compatible vs incompatible renames
  using `types_structurally_similar()` (compares `TypeCategory`: Reference vs
  Array vs Object vs Function vs Primitive vs Tuple)
- Type-compatible renames → `StructuralChangeType::Renamed` (mechanical codemod)
- Type-incompatible renames → `StructuralChangeType::Changed` with `before` =
  old signature, `after` = new signature (routes to LLM-assisted fixing via
  `ApiChangeType::SignatureChanged`)

**Never** drop type-incompatible renames back to separate Removed + Added. This
loses the linkage between old and new prop, producing a useless "remove prop,
find an alternative" fix strategy instead of "prop X was replaced by prop Y
with a different type."

Regression test:
`crates/core/src/diff/compare.rs::test_type_incompatible_member_rename_produces_changed_not_removed_plus_added`
— uses real PatternFly `MenuToggleProps` data
(`splitButtonOptions: SplitButtonOptions` → `splitButtonItems: ReactNode[]`).

### Deprecated Replacement Detection

When a component is relocated to `/deprecated/` AND a differently-named
component replaces it (e.g., `Chip` → `Label`), the standard rename detector
cannot find the relationship because:

1. `Label` already exists in both v5 and v6 (never enters the "added" pool)
2. Relocation detection claims `Chip` before rename detection runs
3. "Chip" and "Label" have zero lexical similarity (LCS = 0)

The **deprecated replacement detection** step in `src/orchestrator.rs` solves
this by using **rendering swap** signals from the SD pipeline. After both TD and
SD pipelines complete but before the report is assembled:

1. `detect_deprecated_replacements()` finds relocated components where host
   components stopped rendering the old component and started rendering a new
   one (e.g., ToolbarFilter stopped rendering `Chip`, started rendering `Label`)
2. `apply_deprecated_replacements()` transforms the structural changes:
   - Relocation entries → `Changed` with `before="Chip"`, `after="Label"`
   - Props relocations → `Changed` with `before="ChipProps"`, `after="LabelProps"`
   - Suppresses redundant signature-changed entries (base class change)
   - Preserves non-replaced relocations (Modal, Tile, etc.) unchanged

The detection filters out Fragment, React.Fragment, other relocated components,
and uses a Group-suffix tiebreaker when candidates have equal host evidence.

Key type: `DeprecatedReplacement` in `crates/core/src/types/sd.rs`
Key functions: `detect_deprecated_replacements()`, `apply_deprecated_replacements()`
  in `src/orchestrator.rs`
Tests: `deprecated_replacement_tests` module in `src/orchestrator.rs` (15 tests)

### Konveyor Rules

- `crates/ts/src/konveyor.rs` — v1 rule generation (TD pipeline)
- `crates/ts/src/konveyor_v2.rs` — v2 rule generation (SD pipeline: composition,
  conformance, context, prop-to-child migration, test impact, CSS removal,
  prop-attribute-override)
- `crates/konveyor-core/src/lib.rs` — Shared rule types, fix strategies

### Testing

```sh
cargo test -p semver-analyzer-ts --lib    # ~650 unit tests
cargo test -p semver-analyzer-ts          # + integration tests
cargo test                                # full suite
```
